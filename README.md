# codeROT - write code, the bad way 
## Features: 
Brings misery to your code, writing code the normal, organised way? whats that?
with codeROT, embrace the pain. embrace ugly, unreadable code.

- Built using Flask, prompt trained Gemini(api), figma, and ofc. prompt engineering to help along the way.
- Gives out errors complaining about how clean and neat your code is *in a very rude way*
- IT cusses you out, makes fun of you for being a good coder and making no errors, how usefull is that...




## Note:
- We set up the flask code, made the ui with html+figma, using AI to help compile it all
- Deployed using Render.
